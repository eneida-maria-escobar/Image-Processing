# Image-Processing

In my image processing project, I built a program to read, manipulate, and save TGA image files. I created an Image class to handle all the image operations, including reading pixel data, storing it, and writing it back after transformations. The core logic lives in Image.cpp, where I defined how to parse image headers, create pixel objects, and apply various modifications like blending, color adjustments, and channel isolations. I used a Makefile to automate the build and run different image processing tasks efficiently. Overall, my program takes input images, applies the desired operations, and outputs the transformed results as new TGA files.
